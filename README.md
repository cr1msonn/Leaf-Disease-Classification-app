# Leaf-Disease-Classification-app
The Leaf Disease Classification App is an AI-powered web application that allows users to classify leaf images based on the presence of diseases.
It utilizes a deep learning model trained on a large dataset of leaf images to accurately identify various types of leaf diseases, including Early Blight, Late Blight, and Healthy leaves.
## Features

- Upload leaf images for disease classification.
- Fast and efficient classification using a pre-trained deep learning model.
- Supports multiple leaf disease categories.
- Provides real-time classification results.

## Technologies Used

- Python: Programming language used for developing the application.
- FastAPI: Python framework for building web APIs.
- PyTorch: Deep learning library used for the leaf disease classification model.
- HTML/CSS: Front-end technologies for creating the user interface.
- Docker: Containerization technology used for packaging and deploying the application.
